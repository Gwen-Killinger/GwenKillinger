Jacob Killinger

Hello, I'm a senior at Grand Valley State University. I am interested in software development
and pretty open to anything in the field. I have a particular interest in game development
and find myself occationally working on minigame in my free time. I am currently working on my
senior capstone project where we are making a translator app for older patient with declining language
capability from being bilingual. Otherwise I am working on a space rougelike game in my free time.
My favorite hobby I have is playing Table top RPGs with my friends every Monday.
